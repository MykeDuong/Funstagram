    <string name="help_body_para">Funstagram is essentially a basic clone of Instagram. It tries to mimic its functionality. In this
    app we have the home page which shows all the images that the user has taken and the images that are taken by other people followed
    by the user. Each post displays the username of the author and the description about the image. Here we have the ability to like (as well as see the total likes) and save the post.
        We can also share the post with our the contacts in our phone through mail.
    The profile fragment shows information about the user. It allows us it to see the number of his/her followers and the number of people he follows.
    We can also see our saved images in the profile page. We also have the feature to edit the user profile </string>
